# USB-Everything

A multi-tool utility suite packed into a single USB.  
Includes automation scripts, security tools, and system utilities — all in one place.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
The `.exe` files are intentionally locked and cannot be executed directly.  
To use the tools, run the PowerShell script `ZhanTool.ps1` from your terminal.  
The locking is handled by a separate script named `loock`,
> which is only responsible for securing the `.exe` files.

## How to Run

1. Plug in the USB.
2. Open PowerShell.
3. Navigate to the USB directory.
4. Run:

```powershell
.\ZhanTool.ps1
